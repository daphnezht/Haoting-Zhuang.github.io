title: E-commerce Product Classification With Images
---
## Background
Nowadays, the retail e-commerce share has been growing with a incredibly fast pace around the world.
For US, in 2016, online sales of physical goods amounted to 360.3 billion US dollars and are projected to surpass 603.4 billion
US dollars in 2021. Despite this fast growth, United States actually rank behind several countries in terms of e-commerce sales as
percentage of total retail sales - in 2016, almost a fifth of China's retail
sales occurred via the internet, compared to only 8.1 percent in the United
States. The UK, South Korea, and Denmark are also ahead of the U.S. in terms of
retail e-commerce share.

Cdiscount.com, Franceâ€™s largest non-food e-commerce company,
 generated nearly 3 billion euros last year. While the company already sells everything
from TVs to trampolines. The list of products is still rapidly growing. By the
end of this year, Cdiscount.com will have over 30 million products up for sale.
This is up from 10 million products only 2 years ago. Ensuring that so many
products are well classified is a challenging task. Currently, Cdiscount.com
applies machine learning algorithms(NLP) to the text description of the products in
order to automatically predict their category. As these methods now seem close
to their maximum potential, Cdiscount.com believes that the next quantitative
improvement will be driven by the application of data science techniques to
images.

## Data Source and size

In this project, the original image dataset is provided on Kaggle by
Cdiscount.com. It consist of more than 15 million images at 180x180 resolution
of almost 9 million products (half of the current catalogue) which fall under
more than 5000 categories (detailed categories). 

Since I only have about 3 weeks to finish the project and don't have access to
the powerful GPUs, I have sampled two sub-datasets with size of 100k images (about 1% of the original dataset).
One subset was randomly sampled while the other one was stratified sampled based on the top level categories (I will 
explain why I did this later). By doing this, I have simplified the original
problem to categorizing 100k images into around 50 top level categories (both
about 1% of the scope of original problem).

## Modeling Steps   

* Transfer Learning:

1. Retrieved all the skill sets related information and counted how frequently each skill appears in the job description(e.g., Python, R).
2. Retrieved sentences which mentioned "year...experience". From there, got the required number of years of experience.
3. Remove all the non-alphabetic characters and stop words. Change the text to lower case. 
3. Remove company names from the job description.
4. Remove common words especially for the ones in section where employers talk about being an equal opportunity employer.
5. Use TF-IDF 2-3 ngrams to tokenized the job description cleaned by the previous two steps.

* Topic Modeling:

1. Initially I was having trouble identifying clear topics. When I used LSA to split the full dataset sets into two topics. I found one is related to medical laboratory research, while the other one is more data science related. Below shows the scatter plot with x & y as the two LSA topic probabilities. Therefore I removed the datapoints related to medical laboratory research (around 100 datapoints). After that, the topic modeling become more clear. 


2. I tried a few techniques include LDA, LSA and NMF. And the one give me the best result is 4-topic-split using NMF. Below I have created a Tableau story book showing the results of exploration data analysis and topic modeling.

## Future Works 

In the future, I would like to:
1. Ensemble the NLP and Image models together to improve the classification
   accuracy.
2. Given more time and resource, I would train the model using the whole
   original dataset and predict on more product categories.
