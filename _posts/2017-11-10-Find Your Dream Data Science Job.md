title: Find Your Dream Job in Data Science
---
Hard to believe that 2/3 of the bootcamp has already past. As the graduation day coming closer, I start to think about job searching. 

It's not an easy process, by doing this project, I hope I could have more insights on:
1. Which are industries that have data science related posting?
2. Who are the top employers?
3. What the key skill sets that they are looking for?
4. How to efficiently find the job that fits me the best?


## Data Source and size

I scraped my data around 900 active job postings from glassdoor.com using the key word "Data Scientist" in Seattle area. For each posting, I obtained the job description, glassdoor estimate salary and several information about the employers include rating, size & revenue. 
   
* Cleaned Data Size:

1. RetrieveRemove
